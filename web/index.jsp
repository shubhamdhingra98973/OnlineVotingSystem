            <p> Election day is one of the most exciting days of the year. Our nation comes together to elect a leader who will represent us on the global stage for the next four years. We will elect a leader that will stand for our rights as citizens, students, employees and employers. We will elect a leader that will hopefully keep their promises. Sounds like a big decision, doesn't it?

It is a big decision, and this election marks a pivotal point in our nation's history. Currently, there are two very distinct paths our country will choose from and it is more important than ever to cast a vote in this election.
